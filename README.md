# Soud reset tool for Ubuntu 20.x using app indicator icon
This little tool shows up as a small icon in the app indicator row, normally on top of your screen. Its only functionality is to reset the sound setup to make it work again after sleep, if you have issues with sound through your monitor not working after the monitor has been sleeping. It also makes a short sound after to verify everything is working correctly. 

## Known issues
- Sometimes you need to do it more than once
- It takes a second or two, so give it a couple of seconds before trying again if it doesn't work the firs time
